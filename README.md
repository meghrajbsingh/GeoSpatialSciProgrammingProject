# GeoSpatial Bike Project

This project analyzes cycling-friendliness metrics in Enschede by evaluating the accessibility of buildings to cycling routes. It calculates metrics such as:

- Percentage of buildings near cycling routes
- Average distance of buildings to the nearest route
- Cycling route density in the study area

It also generates plots to visualize building proximity and summary metrics.

In the future we want to use this to compare metrics between different cities in the Netherlands.
